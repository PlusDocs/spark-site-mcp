description: Build, change, check and publish Spark sites and apps with the Spark MCP tools. Use when the user asks to build a website, web app, store or AI chat app, or to change, check or publish one of their Spark projects, and the spark MCP server is connected.

# Building with Spark

The `spark` MCP server works in a Spark project's chat the way the user would in Spark: Spark designs, writes and publishes the code, and you send the requests, follow the work and check the result. When invoked as a command, the user's request is "$ARGUMENTS".

## Examples

- `/spark:build-with-spark a booking site for my pottery classes`
- `/spark:build-with-spark add a pricing page with our three class packages to Harbor Tours`
- `/spark:build-with-spark check the Harbor Tours home page on a phone`

## Tools

| Tool | Use it for |
| --- | --- |
| `list_projects`, `get_project` | Finding the project the user means, and seeing its pages, its internal tools, what Spark is doing and any question it is waiting on. |
| `plan_project` | Starting a new project. Spark asks one question at a time and ends with a plan. Send the whole conversation every call, with Spark's replies exactly as the tool returned them. |
| `create_project` | Creating the project once the user agreed to the plan, with the plan and the conversation exactly as `plan_project` returned them. Call it once per project. |
| `send_message` | Every change to an existing project. Name the page (`page: "/pricing"`) or internal tool when the request is about one. |
| `get_turn` | Following a request. Pass `waitSeconds` (up to 50) and call again while it is still running. |
| `answer_question` | Answering Spark's question or approval with the user's choice. |
| `stop_build` | Stopping a request the user no longer wants. |
| `view_page` | Looking at the preview, one screen at a time, at `desktop` or `phone` width. |
| `attach_files` | Showing the upload card when the user wants to send files from their computer; pass the ids it gives you to `send_message` as `fileIds`. |
| `publish_project` | Publishing the newest version once Spark has finished and the user asked to publish. |
| `get_history`, `get_credits`, `whoami` | What happened lately, the plan and credits left, and which account is signed in. |

## How to work

1. **Find the project.** Use `list_projects` when the user names a project, and `get_project` to see its pages and whether Spark is busy.
2. **Send the request in the user's words.** Put the facts Spark needs in the message: names, prices, opening hours, the tone they want. Spark sees only what you send, not your conversation. Send links to files in `fileUrls`.
3. **Follow it.** Call `get_turn` with `waitSeconds: 50` until the status is `completed`, `waiting`, `failed` or `stopped`. A change usually takes a few minutes, and a new project's first build about ten. Tell the user what Spark is doing meanwhile; the result's `now` field says it.
4. **Bring questions to the user.** When the status is `waiting`, show the user Spark's question or approval and its choices, and answer with `answer_question` only with what they chose. Never approve on the user's behalf.
5. **Check the result.** After a change to the site, look at the pages it changed with `view_page`, at the width that matters (phone for most visitors), and compare them with what the user asked for before you say it is done. A finished request may also carry a picture of what changed.
6. **Publish only when asked.** Changes stay in the preview until the user publishes. Use `publish_project` when they ask.

## Good to know

- Building uses the user's Build credits. Check `get_credits` when a request fails for lack of credits, and point the user to their plan.
- Messages you send appear in the project's chat in Spark, so the user can continue there with the link each result gives.
- Spark can't delete a project or an internal tool. The user does that in Spark.
